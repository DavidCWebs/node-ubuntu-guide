See last post especially:\r\nhttps://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/394\r\n\r\nWhy this is an issue:\r\nSee the answer titled \"You need to consider permissions during node installation\" in this Stack Overflow answer:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/16151018/npm-throws-error-without-sudo\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is very important:\r\n\"To set a default Node version to be used in any new shell, use the alias 'default' e.g.\r\n\r\n```nvm alias default 0.10```\r\n\r\nOtherwise node isn't recognised in a new shell. This is taken from the NVM readme: \r\n\r\nNode/Ubuntu Issue\r\nhttps://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3911\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
